# IAM Package Consolidation Requirements

## Introduction

The BCBS239 compliance platform currently has two separate IAM implementations that need to be consolidated into a unified system. The legacy `identity_access_management` package contains comprehensive OAuth2 functionality, while the newer `iam` package follows the Service Composer Framework patterns with modern observability features.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Package Structure Unification

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a single, consistent IAM package structure, so that I can easily navigate and maintain the identity and access management code.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN consolidating packages THEN the system SHALL use the `com.bcbs239.compliance.iam` package structure
2. WHEN migrating legacy code THEN the system SHALL preserve all existing OAuth2 functionality
3. WHEN organizing code THEN the system SHALL follow Service Composer Framework patterns
4. WHEN structuring packages THEN the system SHALL maintain clear separation between domain, infrastructure, and application layers

### Requirement 2: OAuth2 Integration Preservation

**User Story:** As a user, I want to continue using OAuth2 authentication with Google and Facebook, so that I can access the system using my existing social accounts.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN authenticating THEN the system SHALL support Google OAuth2 login
2. WHEN authenticating THEN the system SHALL support Facebook OAuth2 login
3. WHEN processing OAuth2 callbacks THEN the system SHALL handle authentication success and failure scenarios
4. WHEN managing OAuth2 tokens THEN the system SHALL securely store and validate JWT tokens
5. WHEN mapping OAuth2 users THEN the system SHALL create appropriate user profiles from provider data

### Requirement 3: Service Composer Framework Integration

**User Story:** As a system architect, I want IAM functionality to integrate with the Service Composer Framework, so that it follows consistent patterns and provides proper observability.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing IAM services THEN the system SHALL use Service Composer Framework reactors
2. WHEN processing authentication events THEN the system SHALL emit appropriate domain events
3. WHEN monitoring IAM operations THEN the system SHALL provide health indicators and metrics
4. WHEN integrating with other modules THEN the system SHALL use the cross-module event bus

### Requirement 4: Repository Layer Consolidation

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a unified repository layer for user data, so that I can consistently access and manage user information across the system.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing user data THEN the system SHALL provide a unified UserRepository interface
2. WHEN managing user sessions THEN the system SHALL use a consistent UserSessionRepository
3. WHEN handling bank role assignments THEN the system SHALL maintain the BankRoleAssignmentRepository functionality
4. WHEN implementing repositories THEN the system SHALL follow the repository pattern with proper abstraction

### Requirement 5: Domain Model Harmonization

**User Story:** As a developer, I want consistent domain models for users and authentication, so that I can work with unified data structures throughout the application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN representing users THEN the system SHALL use a unified User domain model
2. WHEN handling authentication tokens THEN the system SHALL use consistent AuthTokens and JWT structures
3. WHEN managing user roles THEN the system SHALL support both simple roles and bank-specific role assignments
4. WHEN tracking user sessions THEN the system SHALL maintain session state consistently
5. WHEN validating user data THEN the system SHALL use unified Email, FullName, and Address value objects

### Requirement 6: Billing Integration Preservation

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want IAM to continue integrating with the billing system, so that user registration and subscription management work seamlessly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN users register THEN the system SHALL integrate with billing for subscription setup
2. WHEN processing registration THEN the system SHALL use the BillingIntegrationService
3. WHEN managing user lifecycle THEN the system SHALL coordinate with billing events
4. WHEN handling tenant contexts THEN the system SHALL maintain billing relationships

### Requirement 7: Security Configuration Unification

**User Story:** As a security administrator, I want unified security configuration for OAuth2 and JWT handling, so that authentication policies are consistently applied.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN configuring OAuth2 THEN the system SHALL use unified security configuration
2. WHEN handling JWT tokens THEN the system SHALL apply consistent validation and expiration policies
3. WHEN managing authentication flows THEN the system SHALL use standardized success and failure handlers
4. WHEN securing endpoints THEN the system SHALL apply consistent authorization rules

### Requirement 8: Password Management Integration

**User Story:** As a user, I want password reset functionality to work alongside OAuth2 authentication, so that I have multiple options for account recovery.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN resetting passwords THEN the system SHALL provide secure password reset workflows
2. WHEN managing password hashes THEN the system SHALL use secure hashing algorithms
3. WHEN handling mixed authentication THEN the system SHALL support both OAuth2 and password-based login
4. WHEN validating credentials THEN the system SHALL use unified authentication services
