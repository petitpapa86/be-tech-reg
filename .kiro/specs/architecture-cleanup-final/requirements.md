# Architecture Cleanup Final - Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification addresses the final architecture cleanup to eliminate remaining anti-patterns in the billing domain. The goal is to ensure complete compliance with domain-driven design principles by removing domain services, eliminating interface dependencies in favor of functional closures, removing result objects from domain layer, and cleaning up any remaining architectural violations.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Remove Domain Services

**User Story:** As a software architect, I want all domain services moved to the application layer as handlers, so that the domain layer contains only pure domain logic without application concerns.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN examining the domain layer THEN there SHALL be no service classes ending with "Service"
2. WHEN a domain service exists THEN it SHALL be moved to the application layer as a handler
3. IF a corresponding handler already exists in the application layer THEN the domain service SHALL be deleted
4. WHEN moving services THEN all dependencies and references SHALL be updated accordingly
5. WHEN services are removed THEN any empty directories SHALL be cleaned up

### Requirement 2: Eliminate Interface Dependencies

**User Story:** As a software architect, I want all interfaces in the domain layer replaced with functional closures, so that we follow functional programming patterns and reduce coupling.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN examining domain packages THEN there SHALL be no interface definitions for external services
2. WHEN an interface exists for external services THEN it SHALL be replaced with functional closures
3. WHEN replacing interfaces THEN consuming classes SHALL use Function types instead
4. WHEN using functional closures THEN proper factory methods SHALL be provided
5. WHEN interfaces are removed THEN all references SHALL be updated to use closures

### Requirement 3: Remove Result Objects from Domain

**User Story:** As a software architect, I want result objects moved out of the domain layer, so that domain logic remains pure and doesn't contain application-layer concerns.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN examining domain packages THEN result objects SHALL NOT be present
2. WHEN result objects exist in domain THEN they SHALL be moved to application layer
3. IF result objects are only used internally THEN they SHALL be deleted
4. WHEN moving result objects THEN all references SHALL be updated
5. WHEN result objects are removed THEN domain methods SHALL return domain types

### Requirement 4: Clean Up Empty Directories

**User Story:** As a software architect, I want all empty directories removed, so that the codebase structure remains clean and organized.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN directories become empty after cleanup THEN they SHALL be removed
2. WHEN removing directories THEN parent directories SHALL be checked for emptiness
3. WHEN cleaning up THEN only truly empty directories SHALL be removed
4. WHEN directories contain only empty subdirectories THEN they SHALL also be removed
5. WHEN cleanup is complete THEN no empty directories SHALL remain

### Requirement 5: Validate Handler Existence

**User Story:** As a software architect, I want to ensure no duplicate functionality exists between domain services and application handlers, so that we maintain single responsibility and avoid code duplication.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a domain service exists THEN the system SHALL check for corresponding handlers
2. IF a handler already implements the functionality THEN the domain service SHALL be deleted
3. IF no handler exists THEN the domain service SHALL be converted to a handler
4. WHEN converting services THEN proper command/query patterns SHALL be followed
5. WHEN handlers exist THEN they SHALL follow functional programming patterns

### Requirement 6: Update Import References

**User Story:** As a software architect, I want all import statements updated after moving or removing classes, so that the codebase compiles without errors.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN classes are moved or removed THEN all import statements SHALL be updated
2. WHEN imports are updated THEN the system SHALL verify compilation success
3. WHEN references are broken THEN they SHALL be fixed or removed
4. WHEN cleanup is complete THEN there SHALL be no compilation errors
5. WHEN imports are updated THEN unused imports SHALL be removed

### Requirement 7: Maintain Functional Patterns

**User Story:** As a software architect, I want all refactored code to follow functional programming patterns, so that we maintain consistency with the established architecture.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN replacing interfaces THEN functional closures SHALL be used
2. WHEN creating handlers THEN they SHALL use immutable data structures
3. WHEN implementing functionality THEN pure functions SHALL be preferred
4. WHEN handling errors THEN Result pattern SHALL be used consistently
5. WHEN refactoring is complete THEN all code SHALL follow functional principles
