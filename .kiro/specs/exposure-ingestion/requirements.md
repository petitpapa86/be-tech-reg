# Exposure Ingestion Context - Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Exposure Ingestion context handles the upload, parsing, and initial processing of exposure data files from banks. It supports multiple file formats, provides real-time processing feedback, and maintains comprehensive data lineage tracking. This context serves as the entry point for all exposure data into the BCBS 239 compliance system.

3. WHEN partial failures happen THEN the system SHALL process valid records while flagging problematic ones
4. WHEN file corruption is detected THEN the system SHALL reject entire file and preserve original for analysis
5. WHEN recovery is needed THEN the system SHALL support reprocessing of failed batches with corrections

### Requirement 7: Comprehensive File Management Dashboard

**User Story:** As a Data Analyst, I want a comprehensive file management dashboard, so that I can monitor all uploaded files with detailed status and quality metrics.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN dashboard is displayed THEN the system SHALL show summary statistics: total files, last upload date, completed files with success percentage, files in processing with estimated time, and error count
2. WHEN file list is shown THEN the system SHALL display table with columns: Nome File, Data Caricamento, Record count, Stato (status), Qualità (quality percentage), Conformità (compliance percentage), Violazioni (violation count), and Azioni (actions)
3. WHEN file status is tracked THEN the system SHALL maintain states: Completati (completed), In Elaborazione (processing), Con Errori (with errors), Conforme (compliant)
4. WHEN quality metrics are calculated THEN the system SHALL show percentage scores for data quality and BCBS 239 compliance
5. WHEN file actions are available THEN the system SHALL provide view details, download, and export capabilities per file

### Requirement 8: Cloud Storage Integration
