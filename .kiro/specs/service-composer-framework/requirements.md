# Service Composer Framework - Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Service Composer Framework provides a structured approach to building composable web applications using bounded contexts and functional programming patterns. It enables complex business flows by orchestrating multiple autonomous services while maintaining clean separation of concerns through pure functions, closure-based dependency injection, and explicit error handling.

The framework supports both GET operations (data composition) and POST operations (coordinated business flows) through a declarative handler-based architecture that integrates seamlessly with `Result<T, ErrorDetail>` return types and `Maybe<T>` for null safety.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Composition Handler Registration and Discovery

**User Story:** As a Framework Developer, I want automatic handler discovery using @CompositionHandler annotation, so that composition handlers are automatically available without manual configuration.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application starts THEN the system SHALL automatically discover all classes annotated with @CompositionHandler(route = "/pattern", order = N)
2. WHEN handlers are registered THEN the system SHALL organize them by route patterns (e.g., "/exposures", "/dashboard") and HTTP methods (GET/POST)
3. WHEN handler ordering is needed THEN the system SHALL execute handlers in ascending order (order=0 first, then order=1, etc.)
4. WHEN route matching occurs THEN the system SHALL support wildcard patterns (e.g., route = "/*" for global handlers like AuthorizationReactor)
5. WHEN handler interfaces are implemented THEN the system SHALL support both GetCompositionHandler and PostCompositionHandler on the same class

### Requirement 2: GET Request Composition with Context Aggregation Patterns

**User Story:** As an API Developer, I want to compose responses by aggregating data from upstream contexts, so that clients receive complete views without understanding context boundaries.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN GET requests are processed THEN the system SHALL execute composers in dependency order, allowing downstream composers to use data from upstream composers already in the model
2. WHEN composers query upstream contexts THEN they SHALL use closure-based API functions like `Function<BankId, Result<BankSummary, ErrorDetail>>` to access upstream context data
3. WHEN multiple contexts contribute data THEN composers SHALL merge upstream context data into unified response objects (e.g., Dashboard composer aggregates Bank Registry + Risk Calculation + Data Quality data)
4. WHEN upstream context errors occur THEN composers SHALL handle partial failures gracefully, including available data and marking missing data with appropriate error indicators
5. WHEN composition completes THEN the system SHALL return unified response with clear indication of which contexts contributed data and any context-specific errors

### Requirement 3: POST Request Orchestration with Upstream/Downstream Context Coordination

**User Story:** As a Business Process Developer, I want to orchestrate complex business flows respecting upstream/downstream context dependencies, so that coordinated operations maintain proper execution order and context autonomy.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN POST requests are processed THEN the system SHALL execute PostCompositionHandler implementations through three phases: onInitialized, onUpdated, onBackgroundWork with proper upstream/downstream ordering
2. WHEN upstream context reactors execute THEN they SHALL provide data and validation results in the shared model for downstream contexts to consume (e.g., BankValidationReactor sets model["bank"] for downstream use)
3. WHEN downstream context reactors execute THEN they SHALL check upstream results in model and skip processing if upstream contexts failed (e.g., check model["processingPhase"] != "FAILED")
4. WHEN cross-context data access is needed THEN reactors SHALL use closure-based functions to query upstream context APIs rather than direct database access
5. WHEN context coordination completes THEN the system SHALL aggregate results from all contexts and provide unified response with proper error handling from any context failures

### Requirement 4: Composition Context Management

**User Story:** As a Framework User, I want proper context management during composition, so that handlers can share information and maintain request traceability.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN composition begins THEN the system SHALL create a CompositionContext with unique request ID and execution trace
2. WHEN handlers execute THEN the system SHALL provide access to shared context data and error collection
3. WHEN cross-handler communication is needed THEN the system SHALL support context data sharing between handlers
4. WHEN error handling occurs THEN the system SHALL collect errors without stopping execution and provide error summaries
5. WHEN request tracing is required THEN the system SHALL maintain detailed execution logs for debugging and monitoring

### Requirement 5: Error Handling and Compensation

**User Story:** As a System Administrator, I want robust error handling with compensation capabilities, so that partial failures don't leave the system in inconsistent states.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN handler exceptions occur THEN the system SHALL catch exceptions, log details, and continue processing other handlers
2. WHEN compensation is needed THEN the system SHALL support compensating actions for handlers that completed successfully
3. WHEN critical errors happen THEN the system SHALL provide circuit breaker patterns to prevent cascade failures
4. WHEN error reporting occurs THEN the system SHALL provide detailed error information including handler context and stack traces
5. WHEN recovery is attempted THEN the system SHALL support retry mechanisms with exponential backoff for transient failures

### Requirement 6: Performance Monitoring and Metrics

**User Story:** As a Platform Administrator, I want comprehensive performance monitoring, so that I can optimize composition performance and identify bottlenecks.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN handlers execute THEN the system SHALL measure and record execution times for each handler
2. WHEN composition completes THEN the system SHALL provide total composition time and handler contribution breakdown
3. WHEN performance thresholds are exceeded THEN the system SHALL generate alerts and performance warnings
4. WHEN metrics are collected THEN the system SHALL integrate with monitoring systems (Prometheus, Micrometer)
5. WHEN performance analysis is needed THEN the system SHALL provide detailed performance reports and optimization recommendations

### Requirement 7: Security and Authorization Integration

**User Story:** As a Security Administrator, I want composition handlers to respect security boundaries, so that unauthorized access is prevented at the handler level.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN handlers execute THEN the system SHALL provide access to current user context and permissions
2. WHEN authorization is required THEN the system SHALL support handler-level authorization checks
3. WHEN security violations occur THEN the system SHALL prevent handler execution and return appropriate error responses
4. WHEN audit logging is needed THEN the system SHALL log security-related events and access attempts
5. WHEN multi-tenant isolation is required THEN the system SHALL enforce tenant boundaries within handler execution

### Requirement 8: Configuration and Customization

**User Story:** As a Framework Integrator, I want flexible configuration options, so that the framework can be adapted to different application requirements.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN framework configuration is needed THEN the system SHALL support Spring Boot configuration properties for timeouts, thread pools, and other settings
2. WHEN custom serialization is required THEN the system SHALL support pluggable JSON serialization strategies
3. WHEN execution strategies need customization THEN the system SHALL support custom execution engines and threading models
4. WHEN integration points are needed THEN the system SHALL provide extension points for custom behavior injection
5. WHEN environment-specific configuration is required THEN the system SHALL support profile-based configuration with proper defaults

### Requirement 9: Testing and Development Support

**User Story:** As a Developer, I want comprehensive testing support, so that composition handlers can be thoroughly tested in isolation and integration.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN unit testing handlers THEN the system SHALL provide test utilities for mocking composition context and dependencies
2. WHEN integration testing is performed THEN the system SHALL support test harnesses for full composition flow testing
3. WHEN test data is needed THEN the system SHALL provide builders and factories for creating test scenarios
4. WHEN debugging is required THEN the system SHALL provide detailed execution traces and handler state inspection
5. WHEN test automation is implemented THEN the system SHALL integrate with standard testing frameworks (JUnit, TestContainers)

### Requirement 10: Documentation and Introspection

**User Story:** As a System Integrator, I want comprehensive documentation and runtime introspection, so that I can understand and troubleshoot composition flows.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN documentation is generated THEN the system SHALL automatically generate API documentation from handler annotations
2. WHEN runtime introspection is needed THEN the system SHALL provide endpoints for discovering available handlers and their metadata
3. WHEN flow visualization is required THEN the system SHALL generate flow diagrams showing handler dependencies and execution order
4. WHEN troubleshooting occurs THEN the system SHALL provide detailed execution logs and handler state information
5. WHEN developer onboarding happens THEN the system SHALL provide comprehensive examples and best practice documentation
