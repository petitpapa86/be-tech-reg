# Identity & Access Management Context - Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Identity & Access Management (IAM) context is the central authentication and authorization hub for the BCBS 239 SaaS platform. It manages user accounts, bank-specific role assignments, and session management using functional programming patterns, pure business functions, and closure-based dependency injection.

This context implements value objects as Java records, uses `Result<T, ErrorDetail>` for explicit error handling, `Maybe<T>` for null safety, and repository functions as closures to keep business logic framework-independent and highly testable.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: User Registration and Account Creation Flow

**User Story:** As a New Customer, I want to register for the platform by providing my details and selecting a subscription, so that I can access the BCBS 239 compliance system.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN user registration begins THEN the system SHALL collect name, address, email, and automatically assign ADMIN role for the registering user
2. WHEN subscription selection occurs THEN the system SHALL present available tiers (STARTER, PROFESSIONAL, ENTERPRISE) with pricing and limits
3. WHEN payment processing is required THEN the system SHALL integrate with Stripe to create customer and subscription records before allowing platform access
4. WHEN registration completes successfully THEN the system SHALL return authentication tokens and suggest next step: "Configure your first bank"
5. WHEN registration fails THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages and allow retry without losing entered information

### Requirement 2: User Account Management with Value Objects and Pure Functions

**User Story:** As a System Administrator, I want to manage user accounts using pure functions and value objects, so that user management logic is testable and framework-independent.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN users are created THEN the system SHALL use pure function `createUser(CreateUserCommand, Function<Email, Maybe<User>>, Function<User, Result<UserId, ErrorDetail>>)` returning `Result<CreateUserResponse, ErrorDetail>`
2. WHEN value objects are used THEN the system SHALL implement UserId, Email, and PasswordHash as Java records with factory methods like `Email.create(String)` returning `Result<Email, ErrorDetail>`
3. WHEN password validation occurs THEN the system SHALL use pure function `validatePassword(String)` returning `Result<PasswordHash, ErrorDetail>` with bcrypt hashing closure
4. WHEN user lookups are performed THEN the system SHALL use repository closure `Function<Email, Result<Maybe<User>, ErrorDetail>>` for framework-free domain logic
5. WHEN user operations complete THEN the system SHALL publish domain events (`UserCreatedEvent`, `UserDeactivatedEvent`) through internal event handlers

### Requirement 3: BCBS 239 Role-Based Access Control with Granular Permissions

**User Story:** As a Bank Administrator, I want to assign users specific BCBS 239 roles with granular permissions, so that access is properly controlled based on regulatory compliance responsibilities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN BCBS 239 roles are assigned THEN the system SHALL support five-tier hierarchy: VIEWER → DATA_ANALYST → RISK_MANAGER → COMPLIANCE_OFFICER → SYSTEM_ADMIN with specific permission sets
2. WHEN COMPLIANCE_OFFICER role is assigned THEN the system SHALL grant permissions: upload files, generate reports, configure parameters, manage violations, administer users
3. WHEN RISK_MANAGER role is assigned THEN the system SHALL grant permissions: upload files, generate reports, manage violations (no parameter configuration or user administration)
4. WHEN DATA_ANALYST role is assigned THEN the system SHALL grant permissions: upload files only (no report generation, configuration, or violation management)
5. WHEN VIEWER role is assigned THEN the system SHALL grant read-only access with no write permissions to any bounded context
6. WHEN users are assigned to banks THEN the system SHALL allow different roles per bank stored in BankRoleAssignment aggregates with permission matrix validation

### Requirement 4: Authentication and Session Management with Functional Patterns

**User Story:** As a Platform User, I want secure authentication using pure functions and explicit error handling, so that authentication logic is reliable and testable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN authentication occurs THEN the system SHALL use pure function `authenticateUser(AuthenticationCommand, Function<Email, Maybe<User>>, Function<String, Boolean>)` returning `Result<AuthenticationResult, ErrorDetail>`
2. WHEN sessions are created THEN the system SHALL use SessionId value object with factory method `SessionId.generate()` and repository closure `Function<UserSession, Result<SessionId, ErrorDetail>>`
3. WHEN JWT operations are needed THEN the system SHALL use closure-based JWT functions like `Function<User, Result<JwtToken, ErrorDetail>>` for token generation
4. WHEN session validation occurs THEN the system SHALL use pure function `validateSession(JwtToken, Function<SessionId, Maybe<UserSession>>)` returning `Result<TenantContext, ErrorDetail>`
5. WHEN authentication events occur THEN the system SHALL publish domain events (`UserAuthenticatedEvent`, `SessionExpiredEvent`) with internal handlers creating integration events

### Requirement 5: Cross-Context Permission Enforcement with Autonomous Validation

**User Story:** As a Security Officer, I want each bounded context to autonomously validate permissions, so that security is enforced consistently across all contexts without tight coupling.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN AuthorizationReactor executes THEN the system SHALL create TenantContext with detailed permission flags: canUploadFiles, canGenerateReports, canConfigureParameters, canManageViolations, canAdministerUsers
2. WHEN Exposure Ingestion operations are attempted THEN the context SHALL validate TenantContext.canUploadFiles() before allowing file processing
3. WHEN Report Generation operations are attempted THEN the context SHALL validate TenantContext.canGenerateReports() before creating reports
4. WHEN Bank Registry configuration is attempted THEN the context SHALL validate TenantContext.canConfigureParameters() before allowing parameter changes
5. WHEN Data Quality violation management is attempted THEN the context SHALL validate TenantContext.canManageViolations() before allowing violation updates

### Requirement 6: Permission Data Duplication for Autonomous Context Operation

**User Story:** As a System Architect, I want each bounded context to store relevant permission data locally, so that contexts can operate autonomously without cross-context permission queries.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN users are assigned roles THEN the system SHALL publish UserRoleAssignedEvent with minimal data (userId, bankId, role, permissions)
2. WHEN Exposure Ingestion receives role events THEN it SHALL store local permission data in exposure_ingestion.user_permissions table with upload permissions only
3. WHEN Report Generation receives role events THEN it SHALL store local permission data in report_generation.user_permissions table with report generation permissions only
4. WHEN Data Quality receives role events THEN it SHALL store local permission data in data_quality.user_permissions table with violation management permissions only
5. WHEN permission changes occur THEN each context SHALL update its local permission data independently without cross-context dependencies

### Requirement 7: Audit Logging and Compliance

**User Story:** As a Compliance Officer, I want comprehensive audit logs of all access and permission changes, so that we can meet regulatory requirements.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN users authenticate THEN the system SHALL log login attempts, success/failure, and source IP addresses
2. WHEN permissions are modified THEN the system SHALL log who made changes, what changed, and when
3. WHEN bank context switches occur THEN the system SHALL log context changes with timestamps
4. WHEN suspicious activity is detected THEN the system SHALL alert administrators and temporarily lock accounts
5. WHEN audit reports are generated THEN the system SHALL provide detailed access reports for compliance reviews

### Requirement 8: External Identity Provider Integration

**User Story:** As an Enterprise Customer, I want to integrate with our existing SSO system, so that users don't need separate credentials.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN SSO integration is configured THEN the system SHALL support SAML 2.0 and OpenID Connect protocols
2. WHEN external authentication occurs THEN the system SHALL map external user attributes to internal roles
3. WHEN SSO sessions expire THEN the system SHALL handle graceful re-authentication flows
4. WHEN user provisioning happens THEN the system SHALL automatically create accounts from SSO attributes
5. WHEN SSO is unavailable THEN the system SHALL fall back to local authentication methods

### Requirement 9: Post-Registration Bank Configuration Guidance

**User Story:** As a New Customer, I want guided bank configuration after registration, so that I can quickly set up my first bank and start using the platform.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN user completes registration and payment THEN the system SHALL return response with nextStep: "CONFIGURE_BANK" and suggested actions
2. WHEN bank configuration is initiated THEN the system SHALL validate user can add banks within subscription tier limits
3. WHEN first bank is being configured THEN the system SHALL provide step-by-step guidance for ABI code, LEI code, bank name, and capital data entry
4. WHEN bank configuration is completed THEN the system SHALL automatically assign the registering user as BANK_ADMIN for that bank
5. WHEN multiple banks are added THEN the system SHALL enforce subscription limits and suggest tier upgrades when limits are approached

### Requirement 10: API Security and Rate Limiting

**User Story:** As a Platform Administrator, I want to protect APIs from abuse, so that the system remains available and secure.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN API requests are made THEN the system SHALL enforce rate limits per user/IP (1000 requests/hour default)
2. WHEN rate limits are exceeded THEN the system SHALL return 429 Too Many Requests with retry-after headers
3. WHEN API keys are used THEN the system SHALL support service-to-service authentication with scoped permissions
4. WHEN suspicious patterns are detected THEN the system SHALL implement progressive delays and temporary blocks
5. WHEN API security events occur THEN the system SHALL log and alert on potential security threats
