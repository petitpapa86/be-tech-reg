# Risk Calculation Context - Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Risk Calculation context performs BCBS 239 compliant risk calculations, including net exposure computation, capital percentage calculations, and large exposure identification. It implements the core regulatory formulas and business rules required for Basel III large exposure reporting and monitoring.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Net Exposure Calculation

**User Story:** As a Risk Analyst, I want accurate net exposure calculations, so that our large exposure reporting reflects true risk after credit risk mitigation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN gross exposures are processed THEN the system SHALL calculate net exposure as gross_amount minus credit_risk_mitigation
2. WHEN collateral values are applied THEN the system SHALL validate collateral eligibility and haircut factors
3. WHEN currency conversion is needed THEN the system SHALL apply current FX rates and maintain original currency amounts
4. WHEN netting agreements exist THEN the system SHALL apply master netting agreement benefits where applicable
5. WHEN calculation methods are documented THEN the system SHALL record which methodology was used for audit purposes

### Requirement 2: Capital Percentage Computation

**User Story:** As a Compliance Officer, I want precise capital percentage calculations, so that we can accurately identify large exposures and regulatory breaches.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN capital percentages are calculated THEN the system SHALL use formula "(net_exposure_amount / eligible_capital_large_exposures) * 100"
2. WHEN eligible capital is retrieved THEN the system SHALL use the most recent capital data for the reporting period
3. WHEN percentage thresholds are applied THEN the system SHALL flag exposures >= 10% as large exposures
4. WHEN legal limits are checked THEN the system SHALL identify exposures exceeding 25% general limit
5. WHEN calculation precision is maintained THEN the system SHALL use 4 decimal places for percentage calculations

### Requirement 3: Large Exposure Identification and Classification

**User Story:** As a Risk Manager, I want automatic identification of large exposures, so that we can focus monitoring efforts on material risks.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN large exposure thresholds are evaluated THEN the system SHALL classify exposures >= 10% of capital as large exposures
2. WHEN exposure classifications are assigned THEN the system SHALL categorize by sector (CORPORATE, SOVEREIGN, BANK, OTHER)
3. WHEN connected counterparties are identified THEN the system SHALL aggregate exposures to the same economic group
4. WHEN exemptions are applied THEN the system SHALL handle sovereign exposures and other regulatory exemptions
5. WHEN classification changes occur THEN the system SHALL maintain historical classification for trend analysis

### Requirement 4: Limit Breach Detection and Alerting

**User Story:** As a Compliance Officer, I want immediate detection of regulatory limit breaches, so that we can take prompt corrective action.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN limit breaches are detected THEN the system SHALL immediately flag exposures exceeding 25% legal limit
2. WHEN breach severity is assessed THEN the system SHALL categorize as WARNING (>20%), BREACH (>25%), CRITICAL (>30%)
3. WHEN alerts are generated THEN the system SHALL create immediate notifications for COMPLIANCE_OFFICER and above roles
4. WHEN breach tracking occurs THEN the system SHALL maintain breach history and resolution status
5. WHEN escalation is required THEN the system SHALL automatically escalate unresolved breaches after 24 hours

### Requirement 5: Business Rules Engine

**User Story:** As a Risk Administrator, I want configurable business rules, so that calculations can adapt to regulatory changes and bank-specific requirements.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN business rules are configured THEN the system SHALL support parameterized rules for thresholds and calculations
2. WHEN rule changes are made THEN the system SHALL version control rules and maintain audit trails
3. WHEN rules are applied THEN the system SHALL execute rules in proper sequence with dependency management
4. WHEN rule conflicts occur THEN the system SHALL provide conflict resolution and validation mechanisms
5. WHEN rule effectiveness is tracked THEN the system SHALL maintain metrics on rule performance and accuracy

### Requirement 6: Stress Testing and Scenario Analysis

**User Story:** As a Risk Analyst, I want to perform stress testing on exposures, so that we can assess potential impacts under adverse scenarios.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN stress scenarios are applied THEN the system SHALL use configurable stress factors (corporate: 2.1, sovereign: 1.5, bank: 1.8)
2. WHEN scenario calculations run THEN the system SHALL maintain base case and stressed exposure amounts
3. WHEN stress results are analyzed THEN the system SHALL identify which exposures would breach limits under stress
4. WHEN scenario comparisons are made THEN the system SHALL provide side-by-side analysis of multiple scenarios
5. WHEN stress testing reports are generated THEN the system SHALL produce detailed impact analysis and recommendations

### Requirement 7: Calculation Audit Trail and Versioning

**User Story:** As an Internal Auditor, I want complete audit trails of all calculations, so that we can verify accuracy and regulatory compliance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN calculations are performed THEN the system SHALL record calculation timestamp, version, and methodology used
2. WHEN input data changes THEN the system SHALL trigger recalculation and maintain version history
3. WHEN calculation disputes arise THEN the system SHALL provide detailed breakdown of all calculation steps
4. WHEN regulatory reviews occur THEN the system SHALL export calculation details in auditor-friendly formats
5. WHEN calculation accuracy is verified THEN the system SHALL support sample-based validation and reconciliation

### Requirement 8: Performance and Scalability

**User Story:** As a System Administrator, I want efficient calculation processing, so that large exposure portfolios can be processed within regulatory timeframes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN large datasets are processed THEN the system SHALL complete calculations for 100K exposures within 30 minutes
2. WHEN parallel processing is used THEN the system SHALL distribute calculations across available compute resources
3. WHEN incremental updates occur THEN the system SHALL recalculate only affected exposures rather than full portfolio
4. WHEN calculation queues are managed THEN the system SHALL prioritize urgent calculations and manage resource allocation
5. WHEN performance monitoring occurs THEN the system SHALL track calculation times and identify optimization opportunities
