# Report Generation Context - Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Report Generation context creates regulatory-compliant reports in multiple formats for internal stakeholders and supervisory authorities. It implements Italian regulatory templates, supports automated scheduling, and ensures proper distribution channels while maintaining audit trails and compliance validation.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Role-Based Report Generation Authorization

**User Story:** As a Security Administrator, I want report generation permissions validated autonomously, so that only authorized users can generate reports based on their BCBS 239 roles.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN report generation is attempted THEN the system SHALL validate user has report permissions (COMPLIANCE_OFFICER or RISK_MANAGER roles only)
2. WHEN DATA_ANALYST or VIEWER roles attempt report generation THEN the system SHALL reject with "Insufficient permissions for report generation" error
3. WHEN permission validation occurs THEN the system SHALL use locally stored permission data without cross-context queries
4. WHEN role changes happen THEN the system SHALL update local permission cache from UserRoleAssignedEvent
5. WHEN bank context is validated THEN the system SHALL ensure user has report generation permissions for the specific bank_id

### Requirement 2: Multi-Format Report Generation

**User Story:** As a Compliance Officer, I want to generate reports in multiple formats, so that I can meet different stakeholder requirements and regulatory submission formats.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN PDF reports are generated THEN the system SHALL create executive summaries, large exposures analysis, and compliance status sections
2. WHEN Excel reports are created THEN the system SHALL include "Anagrafica" (metadata), "Grandi Esposizioni" (large exposures), and "Riepilogo BCBS 239" (compliance summary) sheets
3. WHEN XML reports are produced THEN the system SHALL use filename pattern "Large_Exposures_{abi_code}_{reporting_date}.xml" with namespace "urn:bancaditalia:xsd:LE:1.0"
4. WHEN format selection occurs THEN the system SHALL allow users to choose single format or multiple formats simultaneously
5. WHEN report validation runs THEN the system SHALL verify format compliance before allowing download or distribution

### Requirement 3: Italian Regulatory Template Compliance

**User Story:** As a Regulatory Reporting Manager, I want reports that comply with Italian regulatory templates, so that we can submit compliant reports to Banca d'Italia and other supervisory authorities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Banca d'Italia templates are used THEN the system SHALL implement current regulatory formats and field requirements
2. WHEN EBA templates are applied THEN the system SHALL support European Banking Authority reporting standards
3. WHEN template versions change THEN the system SHALL maintain multiple template versions and allow selection
4. WHEN custom templates are needed THEN the system SHALL support bank-specific template customization within regulatory constraints
5. WHEN template compliance is verified THEN the system SHALL validate all required fields and formatting rules

### Requirement 3: Automated Report Scheduling

**User Story:** As a Bank Administrator, I want automated report generation, so that regulatory reports are produced consistently without manual intervention.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN monthly schedules are configured THEN the system SHALL automatically generate reports by the 30th day after month-end
2. WHEN crisis mode is activated THEN the system SHALL switch to daily report generation capability
3. WHEN schedule conflicts occur THEN the system SHALL handle holidays and weekends with appropriate date adjustments
4. WHEN generation failures happen THEN the system SHALL retry with exponential backoff and alert administrators
5. WHEN schedule changes are made THEN the system SHALL update future generation dates and notify stakeholders

### Requirement 4: Report Content Aggregation and Validation

**User Story:** As a Risk Manager, I want accurate report content with proper data aggregation, so that our reports reflect true risk positions and compliance status.

#### Acceptance Criteria

3. WHEN data quality issues exist THEN the system SHALL include quality assessment sections with remediation status
4. WHEN historical comparisons are needed THEN the system SHALL provide period-over-period analysis and trend information
5. WHEN report accuracy is validated THEN the system SHALL perform final validation checks before report finalization

### Requirement 5: Secure Distribution and Access Control

**User Story:** As a Security Administrator, I want secure report distribution, so that sensitive regulatory information is properly protected and tracked.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN reports are distributed via email THEN the system SHALL use encrypted email with password-protected attachments
2. WHEN regulatory portals are used THEN the system SHALL support secure API submission to supervisory authorities
3. WHEN download access is provided THEN the system SHALL generate time-limited signed URLs with access logging
4. WHEN distribution lists are managed THEN the system SHALL maintain role-based distribution with approval workflows
5. WHEN access is tracked THEN the system SHALL log all report access, downloads, and distribution activities

### Requirement 6: Report Template Management

### Requirement 8: Performance and Scalability

**User Story:** As a System Administrator, I want efficient report generation, so that large reports can be produced within regulatory timeframes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN large reports are generated THEN the system SHALL complete generation within 30 minutes for portfolios up to 100K exposures
2. WHEN concurrent generation occurs THEN the system SHALL manage multiple report generation requests with proper queuing
3. WHEN resource optimization is needed THEN the system SHALL use efficient data retrieval and processing techniques
4. WHEN generation monitoring occurs THEN the system SHALL provide real-time progress updates and estimated completion times
