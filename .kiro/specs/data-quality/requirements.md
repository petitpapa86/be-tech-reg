# Data Quality Context - Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Data Quality context implements the four core BCBS 239 data quality principles (Principles 3-6) and provides comprehensive compliance monitoring through an integrated dashboard system. It manages violation detection, remediation planning, and quality scoring while maintaining autonomous operation through Service Composer Framework patterns and local data ownership.

5. WHEN integrity violations are found THEN the system SHALL flag inconsistencies and provide specific remediation guidance

### Requirement 2: BCBS 239 Principle 4 - Completeness Assessment

**User Story:** As a Compliance Officer, I want thorough completeness assessment, so that we capture all material risks as required by BCBS 239 Principle 4.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN mandatory fields are checked THEN the system SHALL verify presence of exposure_id, counterparty_name, gross_exposure_amount, currency, and sector
2. WHEN materiality thresholds are applied THEN the system SHALL ensure complete data for exposures >= 10% of capital (large exposure threshold)
3. WHEN coverage analysis is performed THEN the system SHALL verify 95% sector coverage and 90% geographic coverage thresholds
4. WHEN data freshness is assessed THEN the system SHALL ensure no exposure dates are older than reporting date
5. WHEN completeness scores are calculated THEN the system SHALL provide percentage completeness by data category and overall score

### Requirement 3: BCBS 239 Principle 5 - Timeliness Monitoring

**User Story:** As a Risk Manager, I want timeliness monitoring and alerting, so that we meet BCBS 239 Principle 5 timing requirements.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN processing times are tracked THEN the system SHALL monitor data extraction (<2 hours), validation (<1 hour), and report generation (<30 minutes)
2. WHEN SLA compliance is measured THEN the system SHALL ensure total processing time remains under 4-hour SLA
3. WHEN crisis mode is activated THEN the system SHALL support daily reporting capabilities instead of monthly frequency
4. WHEN timing violations occur THEN the system SHALL alert stakeholders and escalate based on severity
5. WHEN timeliness scores are calculated THEN the system SHALL provide metrics on processing speed and deadline adherence

### Requirement 4: BCBS 239 Principle 6 - Adaptability Support

**User Story:** As a Risk Analyst, I want adaptability validation, so that our data supports various analyses as required by BCBS 239 Principle 6.
