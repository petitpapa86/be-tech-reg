# BCBS 239 SaaS Platform - Requirements Document

## Introduction

The BCBS 239 SaaS Platform is a comprehensive regulatory compliance solution that enables Italian banks to meet Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS) 239 requirements for risk data aggregation and reporting. The platform implements a multi-tenant architecture using Domain-Driven Design principles with bounded contexts, functional programming patterns, and closure-based dependency injection.

The system focuses on the four core BCBS 239 data quality principles (Principles 3-6): Accuracy & Integrity, Completeness, Timeliness, and Adaptability, while providing comprehensive reporting capabilities and real-time compliance monitoring.

**Core Architectural Patterns:**
- Value objects as Java records with `Result<T, ErrorDetail>` factory methods
- Pure business functions with explicit error handling using `Result<T, E>` and `Maybe<T>`
- Closure-based dependency injection instead of interface injection
- Repository functions as closures for framework-free domain logic
- Event-driven architecture with domain events, internal handlers, and integration events
- Service Composer framework for coordinated multi-context operations

**Context Mapping and Upstream/Downstream Relationships:**
- **Identity & Access Management**: Upstream to all contexts (provides authentication/authorization)
- **Bank Registry**: Upstream to Exposure Ingestion, Risk Calculation, Data Quality, Report Generation, Billing
- **Exposure Ingestion**: Upstream to Risk Calculation and Data Quality (provides raw exposure data)
- **Risk Calculation**: Upstream to Data Quality and Report Generation (provides calculated exposures)
- **Data Quality**: Upstream to Report Generation (provides compliance scores)
- **Report Generation**: Downstream consumer of all calculation and quality contexts
- **Billing**: Downstream consumer tracking usage from Ingestion and Report Generation

### Requirement 13: Event-Driven Architecture with Domain Events

**User Story:** As a Domain Expert, I want to implement event-driven architecture with proper separation between domain events and integration events, so that business logic remains pure while enabling cross-context communication.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN domain operations complete THEN aggregates SHALL add domain events via `addDomainEvent()` method and publish them synchronously within the same transaction
2. WHEN internal domain events are handled THEN the system SHALL use `DomainEventHandler<T>` functional interface to react, fetch additional data, and publish integration events

### Requirement 14: Service Composer Context Interaction Patterns

**User Story:** As a System Architect, I want to implement proper upstream/downstream context interactions through Service Composer, so that bounded contexts maintain autonomy while enabling coordinated business flows.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN upstream contexts provide data THEN downstream contexts SHALL access data through Service Composer reactors without direct database coupling (e.g., Risk Calculation reactor queries Exposure Ingestion API for raw data)
2. WHEN context orchestration is needed THEN the system SHALL use orchestrators to coordinate flows across multiple contexts in proper dependency order (Identity → Bank Registry → Exposure Ingestion → Risk Calculation → Data Quality → Report Generation)
3. WHEN GET operations aggregate data THEN composers SHALL query upstream contexts through their APIs and merge results (e.g., Dashboard composer queries Bank Registry, Risk Calculation, and Data Quality contexts)
4. WHEN POST operations trigger cascading effects THEN reactors SHALL be organized by bounded context with proper execution order reflecting upstream/downstream dependencies
5. WHEN context boundaries are enforced THEN each context SHALL only directly access its own database schema and communicate with other contexts through Service Composer handlers or integration events

### Requirement 15: Service Composer Flow Coordination Patterns

**User Story:** As a Business Process Designer, I want Service Composer to coordinate complex flows across upstream/downstream contexts, so that business operations span multiple contexts while maintaining proper dependency order.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN exposure upload flows execute THEN the system SHALL coordinate: AuthorizationReactor (order=0) → BankValidationReactor (order=1) → ExposureIngestionReactor (order=2) → RiskCalculationReactor (order=3) → DataQualityReactor (order=4) → ReportGenerationReactor (order=5)
2. WHEN downstream contexts need upstream data THEN reactors SHALL query upstream context APIs through closure-based functions (e.g., Risk Calculation reactor uses `Function<BatchId, Result<List<RawExposure>, ErrorDetail>>` to query Exposure Ingestion)
3. WHEN dashboard composition occurs THEN composers SHALL aggregate from multiple upstream contexts: Bank Registry (bank info) → Exposure Ingestion (processing stats) → Risk Calculation (risk metrics) → Data Quality (compliance scores)
4. WHEN context failures occur THEN downstream reactors SHALL check `model.get("processingPhase")` and skip execution if upstream contexts failed, maintaining proper error propagation
5. WHEN integration events are needed THEN reactors SHALL publish events to notify downstream contexts asynchronously (e.g., ExposureIngestionCompleted → triggers Risk Calculation and Data Quality processing)
