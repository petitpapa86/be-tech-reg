# Billing Scheduling Implementation

## Overview

Task 12 "Implement scheduled jobs and automation" has been successfully completed. This implementation provides comprehensive automation for billing processes including monthly billing execution and dunning process management.

## Components Implemented

### 1. Monthly Billing Scheduler ✅

**File**: `MonthlyBillingScheduler.java`

- **Scheduled Execution**: Runs on the first day of each month at 00:00:00 UTC
- **Saga Orchestration**: Creates and starts monthly billing sagas for all active subscriptions
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling with detailed logging and metrics
- **Manual Triggers**: Support for manual execution for testing and operations
- **Correlation IDs**: Generates correlation IDs in format `userId-billingPeriod`
- **Audit Trail**: Includes metadata for tracking and audit purposes

**Key Features**:
- Automatic detection of active subscriptions
- Saga creation with proper correlation IDs
- Comprehensive result reporting with success/failure metrics
- Manual trigger methods for operations team

### 2. Dunning Process Scheduler ✅

**File**: `DunningProcessScheduler.java`

- **Scheduled Execution**: Runs daily at 09:00 UTC
- **Overdue Detection**: Automatically detects overdue invoices without existing dunning cases
- **Action Execution**: Processes dunning cases ready for their next action
- **Async Processing**: Uses thread pool for non-blocking dunning action execution
- **Statistics**: Provides comprehensive statistics for monitoring

**Key Features**:
- Creates dunning cases for newly overdue invoices
- Executes dunning actions for ready cases
- Resolves dunning cases when payments are received
- Provides detailed statistics and monitoring

### 3. Dunning Action Executor ✅

**File**: `DunningActionExecutor.java`

- **Step-based Actions**: Executes appropriate actions based on dunning step
- **Email Notifications**: Sends templated emails for each dunning step
- **Account Suspension**: Handles account suspension for final step
- **Template Data**: Creates comprehensive template data for notifications

**Dunning Steps**:
1. **Step 1**: First reminder (gentle payment reminder)
2. **Step 2**: Second reminder (urgent with late fee warning)
3. **Step 3**: Final notice (suspension warning)
4. **Step 4**: Account suspension (service access suspended)

### 4. Notification Service ✅

**File**: `DunningNotificationService.java`

- **Multi-channel Support**: Email, SMS, and push notifications
- **Template Engine**: Mock template rendering for different notification types
- **Delivery Tracking**: Records notification delivery status for audit
- **Failure Handling**: Proper error handling and retry logic

### 5. Configuration ✅

**Files**: 
- `BillingSchedulingConfiguration.java`
- `application-billing.yml`

- **Spring Scheduling**: Enables scheduling with dedicated thread pool
- **Conditional Beans**: Schedulers can be enabled/disabled via configuration
- **Monitoring Integration**: Wraps sagas with monitoring and audit logging
- **Configurable Settings**: Cron expressions, thread pool sizes, notification settings

### 6. REST API ✅

**File**: `BillingSchedulingController.java`

- **Manual Triggers**: Endpoints for manually triggering scheduled jobs
- **Statistics**: Endpoints for monitoring dunning process statistics
- **Resolution**: Endpoint for manually resolving dunning cases
- **Status**: Endpoint for checking scheduler status and configuration

**Endpoints**:
- `POST /api/v1/billing/scheduling/monthly-billing/trigger-current`
- `POST /api/v1/billing/scheduling/monthly-billing/trigger-previous`
- `POST /api/v1/billing/scheduling/monthly-billing/trigger/{year}/{month}`
- `POST /api/v1/billing/scheduling/dunning-process/trigger`
- `GET /api/v1/billing/scheduling/dunning-process/statistics`
- `POST /api/v1/billing/scheduling/dunning-process/resolve/{invoiceId}`
- `GET /api/v1/billing/scheduling/status`

### 7. Repository Enhancements ✅

**Enhanced Methods**:
- `JpaDunningCaseRepository`: Added methods for finding ready cases and statistics
- `JpaInvoiceRepository`: Added method for finding overdue invoices without dunning cases

### 8. Testing ✅

**Files**:
- `MonthlyBillingSchedulerTest.java` (existing)
- `DunningProcessSchedulerTest.java` (new)

Comprehensive test coverage for scheduler functionality including:
- Saga creation for active subscriptions
- Dunning case creation and processing
- Error handling scenarios
- Statistics generation

## Configuration

### Scheduling Configuration

```yaml
billing:
  scheduling:
    monthly-billing:
      enabled: true
      cron: "0 0 0 1 * ?" # First day of month at midnight UTC
      timezone: "UTC"
    dunning-process:
      enabled: true
      cron: "0 0 9 * * ?" # Daily at 9 AM UTC
      timezone: "UTC"
      thread-pool-size: 5
```

### Notification Configuration

```yaml
billing:
  notifications:
    email:
      enabled: true
      templates:
        first-reminder: "first-payment-reminder"
        second-reminder: "second-payment-reminder"
        final-notice: "final-payment-notice"
        suspension-notice: "account-suspension-notice"
    sms:
      enabled: false
    push:
      enabled: false
```

## Security

- **Role-based Access**: Endpoints protected with `@PreAuthorize`
- **Admin Operations**: Manual triggers require `BILLING_ADMIN` role
- **Read Operations**: Statistics endpoints allow `BILLING_VIEWER` role

## Monitoring and Observability

- **Audit Logging**: All scheduler actions are logged for compliance
- **Performance Metrics**: Execution times and success rates tracked
- **Health Checks**: Scheduler status included in health endpoints
- **Statistics**: Comprehensive statistics for monitoring dashboards

## Error Handling

- **Graceful Degradation**: Failures in individual operations don't stop the entire process
- **Retry Logic**: Built-in retry mechanisms for transient failures
- **Detailed Logging**: Comprehensive error logging for troubleshooting
- **Metrics**: Failure rates tracked for monitoring

## Operational Features

- **Manual Triggers**: Operations team can manually trigger any scheduled job
- **Flexible Scheduling**: Cron expressions configurable via properties
- **Thread Pool Management**: Dedicated thread pools for different operations
- **Conditional Execution**: Schedulers can be enabled/disabled without code changes

## Integration Points

- **Saga Orchestration**: Integrates with core saga infrastructure
- **Monitoring**: Uses existing monitoring and audit services
- **Event Publishing**: Publishes events for cross-module communication
- **Repository Pattern**: Uses existing functional repository patterns

## Requirements Satisfied

- ✅ **12.1**: Monthly billing scheduler with error handling and retry logic
- ✅ **12.2**: Dunning process scheduler with overdue detection and automation
- ✅ **12.3**: Dunning step progression automation
- ✅ **12.5**: Comprehensive error handling and monitoring

The implementation provides a robust, scalable, and maintainable solution for billing automation that integrates seamlessly with the existing architecture while providing comprehensive monitoring and operational capabilities.
