# regtech-signal

This module provides Server-Sent Events (SSE) / signaling support for the RegTech front-end.

Structure:
- domain/: pure business types and value objects
- application/: use cases and ports
- infrastructure/: adapters, messaging, storage
- presentation/: REST controllers / SSE endpoints

This is scaffolding only. Add implementation classes and dependencies as needed.
