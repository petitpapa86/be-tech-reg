/**
 * Core Capability
 *
 * This capability contains the fundamental domain building blocks and
 * utilities used throughout the regtech-core module. It provides the
 * basic abstractions and patterns that form the foundation of the
 * domain layer.
 *
 * Key responsibilities:
 * - Base entity definitions and patterns
 * - Functional programming utilities (Maybe, Result)
 * - Core domain abstractions and interfaces
 * - Foundational domain concepts
 *
 * Components:
 * - Entity: Base class for domain entities with common behavior
 * - Maybe: Functional option type for handling optional values
 * - Result: Functional result type for handling success/failure operations
